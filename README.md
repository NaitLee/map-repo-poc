A GitHub Pages site to give a Proof-of-Concept about Xonotic-Map-Repo frontend.

Update: the upstream `maps.json` didn’t change between 2022-12-23 and 2023-02-03, so full version of binary data is served with guarantee to data stability. It’s a fully working “site” together with the original service.
